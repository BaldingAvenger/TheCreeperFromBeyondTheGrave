# TheCreeperFromBeyondTheGrave
The Creeper from Beyond the Grave    A combination of exploration, tech, and a magic wand or two.  Designed to allow a focus on Ender IO with helpful tools for storage and mining.   Of course there is a lot of dark, scariness out there.  Vampires, Shaggoths, Blood Moons, and more are out to get you.  Lots of armor, weapons, sensors, and golems will help you defend your base and the large villages you will find.    Did I mention airplanes and elevators?  Tails and player models?  Tutorial quests and tweaked recipes?  Open Computers &amp; ProjectE?
